	<p>
	Man has always been searching for new and innovative methods to better the way of living not only for himself but for the society at large.
	As the mental growth happened and man became more and more aware of nature and surroundings, the time came to work on the Spiritual side of the person.
	</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>
	A class of spiritual experts came into existence that got the knowledge of unknown and invisible through their ever expanding and universal approach. 
	There were some enthusiasts who worked on conquering the ultimate.
	Sufferings, pain, lack of awareness, lack of knowledge and fear of natural calamities, spreading of deadly diseases called Heavenly Curse were common and there seemed to be no respite. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Medical Science came to rescue of those who were suffering due to diseases.
	Medical science although is very successful yet it lacks in certain areas like Emotional and Spiritual well-being.
	It was discovered that Spiritual enhancement is as important as physical fitness.
	Spiritually rich person can fight with any disorder whether Psychological or Physical.
	</p>
	<p>
	Ajay Jainâ€™s Divine Service aims at curing people of their mental and spiritual illness at the initial stage and slowly and gradually creating awareness and atmosphere in the society so that no more sickness prevails and all are mentally strong and spiritually rich.
    May everyone be free of all worries and remains full of energy.

	<h3>The Master - Ajay Jain</h3>
	<img src="images/stills/Arachrya Dr Ajay Jain.jpg">
	<p>
	Ajay Jain is a cheerful, interactive and humble person. Born on 15th August, he comes from a family of well-read and spiritually enhanced parents. After completing his higher studies, Ajay Jain transformed his life style as a socially, mentally and spiritually conscious person. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Transformation begins with restlessness. If it converts into quest, it can lead to the awakening of the sub conscious mind, then to spiritual consciousness, social awareness and ultimately to enlightenment.
	The quest for self has lead him to the higher levels of consciousness which helps him helping the needy and other segments of the society.
	</p>
	<p>
	He believes that we all are part of the cosmos and there is more to the life than what meets the eye. There are unseen auras, unheard heartbeats and unfelt healing touches.
	Ajay Jain can rightly be called pioneer in Meditation and Vastu Remedies as he started Vastu consultations in the year...

				I was able to become thoughtless, which was the main objective.
				I found the class very useful to understand why focus on one activity at a time is important and how it helps in achieving a clutter free mind.
				Short breathe is very useful to achieve thoughtlessness.
